&DESCRIBE here=%tHere is where you will begin building the character you want to play as in Requiem for Kingsmouth. Before we begin, the Staff ask that you read the RULES. When you are finished reading the RULES, type ACCEPT. With that out of the way, you will embark on a short, easy journey to find out WHO you are and what you will be doing in the game. In the next room, you will select your primary and secondary attributes and be granted a certain number of 'points' that you will spend on various attributes for your character. Use them wisely, because they will disappear when the character generation is finished. %r%rOnce you read the RULES, and ACCEPT them, please exit through one of the marked doors: VAMPIRE, HUMAN, or GHOUL.%r%rCommands:%rrules - Read the rules.%raccept - Accept the rules after you have read them.%rreset - Reset your character and start from scratch%r%rA few commands you will likely want to set before moving on:%r@set me=color	This will allow you to see pretty colors.%r@set me=ENTER_OK	This will allow people to give you things, if necessary.%r@lock me=me	This will prevent anyone from picking you up and carrying you around.%r%rA list of other helpful commands can be found at +HELP COMMANDS.%r%r+HELP CHARGEN will give you character-generation-specific commands.%rIf you have any difficulties, Type +pub I need help, and the lovely people on channel will try to help you!%r%rhttp://kingsmouth.info/wiki/Character_Creation/Walkthrough
